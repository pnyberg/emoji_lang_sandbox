# emoji_lang
Playing around with the programming language Emoji, https://esolangs.org/wiki/Emoji.

Currently working with online-compiler [tio.run](https://tio.run) but will sooner or 
 later try to get it to work with an offline-compiler, possibly from [https://github.com/vpzomtrrfrt/emoji.py](https://github.com/vpzomtrrfrt/emoji.py).
 
Example-mains include in the code.

# Current implementations:
## For-loop
[Code](src/for_loop.emoji)

## Quicksort (sorting int-array)
[Code](src/quicksort_array.emoji)
